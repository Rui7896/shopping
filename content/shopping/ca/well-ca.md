For example, the Attitude Home Care brand is offering a 20% discount on all its home care products. Essential household items like laundry detergents and dishwasher water - soluble tablets can be taken home at super - low prices. It's truly a boon for thrifty shoppers. The routine personal care brand is also not far behind. Products such as toothpaste and natural deodorants are also on sale with a 20% price cut. And they are formulated without baking soda, which is very friendly to people with sensitive skin. AOR health supplements offer a maximum discount of 20%. Products like B - complex vitamins and L - carnitine, some of which are marked with NPN (Canadian Natural Product Number), ensure quality and make you feel confident when consuming them. The Vital Proteins collagen series also has a 15% discount. You can choose from various flavors of bovine/marine collagen powder and coffee creamer, allowing you to glow from the inside out.

In addition to brand - specific discounts, category - wide promotions are also quite eye - catching. You can save up to 20% on母婴用品 (Maternal and infant products). Items like baby diapers and skincare products are essential for a baby's growth. The sun protection section is bustling.

Products such as deodorants and toothpaste are like gentle caregivers, especially suitable for people with sensitive skin. The high - end beauty device, the FOREO LED mask, although a bit pricey at $749 CAD, is definitely worth it considering the high - tech skin care it can provide.
