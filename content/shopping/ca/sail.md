When it comes to marketing strategies, SAIL has many tricks! It emphasizes its Canadian brand identity and may rely on local supply chains and offline stores, just like having a reliable back - up, which makes us trust it more. Through slogans like "Build your perfect tackle box" and "Get ready for camping season", it combines products with specific usage scenarios, making it easier for us to make decisions when purchasing. Moreover, the membership system, with long - term discounts (Explore +) and exclusive activities (contests) is like two magic wands, enhancing user loyalty and promoting our repeat purchases.
