Guys, today I'll take you on a tour of the official website homepage of the pet supplies retail brand PetSmart. The promotions here are so numerous that they're simply dazzling, like stepping into a "shopping paradise" for pets!

### Abundant Promotional Activities
The core of the website lies in various promotional information. There are discounts in all areas, ranging from pet food and supplies to services.

#### Great Discounts on Pet Food
First off, there are significant discounts on pet food. By using the promo code "SAVE20", you can get an additional 20% off on thousands of products. However, this event ends on June 8th, and there's only 1 day left now, so you guys have to hurry up! For the Stella & Chewy's brand, you can get $5 off when your purchase reaches $30. Their主推 "Wild Red" series of raw - coated dog food is high - protein and free of grains and beans, which is simply a healthy feast for your furry friends. The Simply Nourish dog food is also a great deal. It's buy - one - get - one, and you can get an additional 25% off on the second item. It features a single animal protein (salmon) and a hypoallergenic formula, making it perfect for pets with sensitive stomachs. If you choose to subscribe to the automatic delivery service of brands like Frontline and Royal Canin for the first time, you can enjoy a 40% - 50% discount, and there's also a 5% discount on subsequent orders. Moreover, when you spend $25 on dog food and snacks, you can earn 2500 points, which are equivalent to $5 and can be directly used to offset your order!

#### Numerous Benefits for Supplies and Health Care
There are also many discounts on pet supplies and health care. You can earn double points on the Seresto flea collar, and there's a 40% discount on the first automatic delivery of Frontline. The reptile section is full of great offers. When you spend $50, you can earn 7500 points (equivalent to $15 for deduction), there's a 40% discount on the first automatic delivery of food and supplements, and there's up to a 50% discount on habitats and lighting equipment. There are also clearance items. For the VET·IQ calming supplement, it's buy - one - get - one (with a 50% discount on the second item). You really have to stock up on these!

#### Super Cost - effective Multi - Category Stacked Discounts
The website is classified by pet type, and there are independent promotional entryways for categories such as dogs, cats, fish, birds, reptiles, and small pets, which makes it convenient for you to quickly filter. Moreover, some products support "stacked discounts", where you can use both discount codes and points for deduction. This combination of discounts can save you a lot of money!

### One - Stop Pet Care Services
In addition to product promotions, PetSmart also has outstanding offline service capabilities and uses membership points to attract customers.
The grooming service has launched a summer salon special offer. There are not only freebies like headbands and toys but also double points, allowing your furry friend to spend a beautiful summer! The 6 - week training course only costs $129, which is only $21.5 per week. It's really worth spending this money to give your pet good training habits!
The boarding and daycare services are also very considerate. At PetHotel, you get 1 free night when you stay for 4 nights, and new users of the dog daycare camp can enjoy a half - price experience on the first day. You can rest assured to leave your furry friend with them and go about your own business with peace of mind. And Treats members can accumulate points for every dollar spent, and these points can be used to redeem services or products.

### Treats Rewards Membership Benefits
Becoming a Treats Rewards member has many benefits! You can earn points when shopping and using services. 100 points are equivalent to $1 and can be directly used to offset the order amount. Members also have exclusive events and can participate in free lucky draws. You might just win 500,000 points, which are enough to redeem a year's worth of pet essentials! When you buy gift cards worth $100, you can enjoy a 10% discount, but the promo code "PETDAD25" expires on June 15th. In addition, members have privileges such as early access to promotional activities, birthday benefits, and a lower threshold for free delivery. This membership is really amazing!

PetSmart also offers convenient shopping channels. After placing an order online, you can pick it up at the store within 2 hours for free. It's as fast as lightning! Some products also offer free same - day delivery service, so you don't have to wait long. The automatic delivery service is also very practical. You can get a 35% discount on the first order, a 5% discount on subsequent orders, and free delivery, which is especially suitable for long - term stocking. Downloading the PetSmart app allows you to activate discounts, book services, and track orders at any time. It's very convenient!

The website mainly promotes well - known brands such as Hill's Science Diet, Blue Buffalo, and Stella & Chewy's, emphasizing veterinarian recommendations and high - quality formulas, so you can shop with confidence. And through the PetSmart Charities link, it can guide you to participate in pet public welfare undertakings, enhancing the brand's social image. This brand really has both quality and kindness!
